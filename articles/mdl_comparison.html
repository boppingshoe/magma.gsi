</h2>
<p>MAGMA is a Bayesian mixture model used for GSI applications. When we
“run” the MAGMA model, we employ a MCMC algorithm to estimate stock
proportions, age-by-stock composition, and individual group membership
assignments. MAGMA algorithm is modified from a mixture model first
developed by Pella and Masuda (2001; i.e., Pella-Masuda model or “fully
Bayesian” model). The underlying principles of MAGMA and Pella-Masuda
models are the same, except that MAGMA incorporates age and marking
information in addition to the genetics. Also, MAGMA is designed for
analyses containing multiple strata, which makes running MAGMA model
more computationally intensive than the Pella-Masuda model.</p>
<p>That is not to say that the Pella-Masuda model is simple; it has an
intricate algorithm and running the program BAYES can be a
time-consuming process. To decrease time spent on running the model (and
improve convergence of the MCMC sampler), Moran and Anderson (2018)
developed a conditional mixture model by modifying the Pella-Masuda
model. The conditional model (i.e., “conditional GSI”) streamlines the
fully Bayesian algorithm by eliminating a step to recalculate allele
frequencies of the baseline populations. This step is often referred to
as “baseline re-sampling,” where, at each iteration of MCMC sampling,
mixture individuals are assigned a new population membership, and the
allele frequencies of each population can shift due to changes in its
membership. Therefore, in the fully Bayesian algorithm, allele
frequencies are re-calculated at each iteration. This step can be
computational intensive with a large mixture sample and/or a big genetic
marker set.</p>
<p>Moran and Anderson (2018) found that the baseline re-sampling step
can be mathematically integrated out of the model algorithm, and the
resulting conditional model would yield the same results as the fully
Bayesian model without the computationally intensive calculations. We
incorporate the conditional model in the sampling algorithm for MAGMA,
but with some modifications to incorporate age and marking information.
Basically, our modifications to MAGMA algorithm are a hybrid of the
fully Bayesian and the conditional models.</p>
<p>However, we have not assessed the effects of the hybrid model on the
estimation in a MAGMA setting. In this document, I use a
cross-validation analysis to assess the possible effects of the hybrid
conditional GSI on the accuracy and precision of the MAGMA model.</p>

<p>I updated the analysis with Lynn Canal sockeye baseline and a
multi-stratum set up. Lynn Canal post-season reporting has 251
collections divided into seven groups. Majority of collections are
included in the “Other” reporting group. For age, there are 15 classes
total. Five of them are major age classes (03, 12, 13, 22, 23), and the
rest are included in “other.”</p>

</h3>
<p>I used a Yukon Chinook baseline for the simulation. The Chinook
baseline was modified in a previous analysis and contained only a
portion of the original collections. This modified baseline had a
marker-set of 380 loci that could differentiate Chinook salmon among
four reporting groups from the middle/upper Yukon River (Koyukuk,
Tanana, Upper U.S., and Canada; Lee et al. 2021). I used the modified
baseline to generate 100 sets of MAGMA mixtures (one district, one
subdistrict, and one week) with randomly set age-by-stock compositions,
and ran the mixtures using hybrid conditional GSI and fully Bayesian
algorithms. Finally, I calculated and compared root mean-square-errors
(RMSE), deviations, and mean bias for the 100 simulations.</p>
<p>Procedures for generating one set of MAGMA data are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Randomly set proportions for the four reporting groups. Based on
the set proportions, randomly allocate 190 individuals to populations
within each reporting group.</p></li>
<li><p>Simulate genotypes of mixture individuals based on the baseline
allele frequencies corresponding to their assigned population
memberships. The simulated values are drawn from multinomial
distributions.</p></li>
<li><p>randomly set proportions for the age-by-stock compositions. The
age-by-stock composition is a

matrix with rows represent reporting groups and columns represent age
classes. There are nine age classes and they are ages 1.1, 1.2, 1.3,
2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3. The proportions for ages 1.1, 1.2, and
3.3 are always 0’s in this analysis, and the rest are randomly set. The
age proportions within each reporting group add up to 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Assign an age for each mixture individual based on its assigned
reporting group membership. Randomly withheld the age identities for 15%
of the mixture individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>Format the data set for MAGMA model (using
<code>magmatize data()</code> function). There is only one district, one
subdistrict, and one week in the mixture data set.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I ran each of the 100 MAGMA data sets with two model algorithms: 1)
“conditional GSI”: a hybrid algorithms that re-sample baseline allele
frequencies every 10th iteration and 2) “fully Bayesian”: re-sample
baseline allele frequencies every iteration. I ran each model with 1,000
iterations, 500 burn-ins, no thinning, and four chains with “zero out”
age priors.</p>
<p>I compared the posterior means and the true proportions of the nine
age classes and calculated RMSE and bias/deviation. RMSE is calculated
as

<p>Simulations for Lynn Canal followed the same procedures as before,

set had 0 portion for all minor age classes. The second set had a small
portion (randomly set) for some of the minor age classes.</p>
<p>Harvest were randomly selected from the 2023 harvest record to
represent a simulated harvest for the four strata in each iteration of

<p>The comparison of 100 cross-validation analyses of the two algorithms
showed similar precision, RMSE, and bias for the major age classes.
Hybrid conditional GSI showed slightly less deviations compared to the
fully Bayesian algorithm. It is unclear that the slightly lower portions
of deviations for the hybrid conditional GSI were due to chances or
actually an indication of better performance of the algorithm. However,
comparison of convergence diagnostics show little differences between
the two algorithms.</p>
<p>The performance of the two MAGMA algorithms seems to be comparable,
but the running time of the hybrid conditional GSI was shorter. If we
considered time to run the MAGMA model as the monetary currency, hybrid
conditional GSI is like a Chinese electric vehicle with the same
performance but a fraction of the price compared to its US and European
counterpart. From that perspective, there seems to be a clear benefit to
run MAGMA using hybrid conditional GSI algorithm<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;Glad that ADF&amp;amp;G does not impose a 100% tariff on
methods developed by other agencies.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this analysis is not comprehensive because
there was only one stratum in the simulation. MAGMA is usually run in a
multi-stratum scenario, and the effects of multiple strata was untested
in this analysis. Also, the analysis was tested using a baseline from a
region that has not used MAGMA. Further assessments should be done with
other baselines (preferably from regions that have employed MAGMA) to
ensure that different baselines yield the same results.</p>
