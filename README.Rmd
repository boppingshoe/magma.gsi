*MAGMA* is a slowing moving but powerful model that combine mark and age information with genetic mixture analysis. Mainly, *MAGMA* estimates two sets of parameters: stock and age. A composition of the two, information that is often required for run reconstruction models, is simply the product of these two sets of parameters. After all age/stock compositions in other strata are calculated in the same fashion, they are multiplied by the harvest proportions of their corresponding strata and summed up to get a weighted average age/stock composition.

## Installation

You can install the development version of *magma.gsi* from [GitHub](https://github.com/boppingshoe/magma.gsi) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("boppingshoe/magma.gsi", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example

Once you have the data sets up at a designated directory, you can compile the input object:

```{r inp}
library(magma.gsi)

wd <- getwd() # path to data folder
magma_data <- magmatize_data(wd = paste0(wd, "/vignettes"), save_data = FALSE)

```

Run the model:

```{r run model}
magma_out <- magmatize_mdl(magma_data, nreps = 50, nburn = 25, thin = 1, nchains = 3)

```

Summarize the results:

```{r summary}
magma_summ <- magmatize_summ(ma_out = magma_out, ma_dat = magma_data, summ_level = "district", type = "age")

magma_summ$age_summ[1]

```

There's a function in the package to make trace plots and inspect mixing of chains.

```{r example_trace_plot}
tr_plot(magma_summ$age_prop[[1]])

```

To see more examples on using *magma.gsi*, you can call the manual using `vignette("magma-vignette", package = "magma.gsi")` after you installed *magma.gsi*.
