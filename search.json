MAGMA based Pella-Masuda model (Pella & Masuda, 2001) incorporates information age hatchery group membership using matched scales otoliths allow detailed stock composition estimates. Mainly, MAGMA estimates two sets parameters: population age. mixture (stratum), MAGMA estimates vector population proportions wild hatchery groups. mixtures (strata) within year, MAGMA estimates matrix age proportions row represents wild hatchery population. Populations combined represent reporting group fishery stock. age--stock composition, information often required run reconstruction models, simply product age stock parameters. single-stratum example shown , can see age--stock composition presented. matrix made-age proportions follows: made-stock proportions 0.7 0.3 stock B stratum. Multiplying age stock proportions stock: age--stock composition1 stratum : age/stock compositions strata calculated fashion, multiplied harvest proportions corresponding strata summed get weighted average age/stock composition whole fishery. Age proportions estimated combining mixtures/strata within year, can counter-intuitive first glance. , may reasonable assume mixtures share age distribution. However, MAGMA model, age compositions adjusted according stock proportions mixture (.e., stratum). stock proportions different mixtures mixtures, differences stock compositions drive differences age compositions mixtures. previous example, stock consists mainly (50%) age 3 fish 70% total mixture population. Therefore, age 3 fish stock dominant class mixture population. another stratum, stock B might majority mixture populations. case, expect see age 2 dominant class compositions driven mostly stock B. required individuals data set observed genotype age. Base data available, MAGMA model assigns likely membership population /age individual unobserved genotype /age. However, adequate sample genotyped individuals represent stratum data set. inadequate number (small zero sample size) genotyped individuals stratum, MAGMA model estimates population proportions stratum based overall proportions strata combined. Estimation age population compositions MAGMA model done algorithm called Gibbs sampler. process initialized stochastically assigning individuals unobserved identities group membership population age class based specified priors, proportions populations age classes “estimated” drawing values full conditional distributions2 population age classes. full conditional distributions mainly based numbers individuals counted population age group. Gibbs sampler proceeds following steps: Determine population memberships mixture individuals : stochastically assign (wild) population membership individual without observed identity genotypes based genotypic frequencies population proportions, stochastically assign (wild) population membership individual without observed identity without genotypes based population proportions. individual’s age unobserved, assign age based age composition assigned population membership. Draw updated values population age proportions baseline allele frequencies full conditional distributions based updates : tallies individuals age class population (assigned observed) wild hatchery groups specified prior values. algorithm repeated simulations converged posterior distribution parameters, usually takes thousands iterations. adapted modified version conditional genetic stock identification (conditional GSI; Moran & Anderson 2018) model running MAGMA. modification speeds Gibbs sampler algorithm compared conventional “fully Bayesian” approach baseline allele frequencies updated every 10th iteration modified conditional GSI algorithm.
